//  This code instantiates an image whose pixels are represented with
//  type \code{unsigned short}. The image is then created and assigned to a
//  \doxygen{itk}{SmartPointer}. Later in the text we will discuss
//  \code{SmartPointer}s in detail, for now think of it as a handle on an
//  instance of an object (see section \ref{sec:SmartPointers} for more
//  information).
